# Growing Voter Engagement in Communities of Color
We are currently working on a BU Spark! Data Mechanics class project. Our partner is Amplify Latinx. We are looking for areas where there is an opportunity to increase the voter registration rate and voter turnout, particularly among communities of color.

For project #1, we combined several datasets into three which we may use in the future projects. 

1. We fetch the dataset of ages in different congressional districts from US Census Bureau website, and combine them with the dataset from our partnerâ€™s more detailed dataset to get the age and gender distribution in different CDs.
2. We fetch the map of 10 CD in MA from US Census Bureau website for the past couple of years, convert them into standard GeoJson format (using ogr2ogr tool) and categorize them by their CD id.
3. We fetch the dataset of candidates and candidate's committees from MA OCPF website, and combine the information with all registered candidate office districts to find the correlation between candidates and districts.
