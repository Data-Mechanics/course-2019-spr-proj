        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>As of 2018, over 11,000 restaurants were operating in the Greater Boston region, 
            and faced with the challenges to survive, each restaurant does its best to stand out. 
            From the uniqueness of the dishes to the ambience and location, everything is utilized 
            by restaurants to ensure that customers are satisfied and come back for more. Customers 
            also face challenges when trying to pick 1 out of 11,000 restaurants to dine at. Preferences
            such as cuisine, price, distance, and even time of day become important deciding factors 
            for locals. But for tourists unfamiliar with Boston, navigating through Boston’s cityscape 
            let alone picking a restaurant to dine at becomes a challenge. To help both tourists and locals, 
            we utilize datasets relating to the city of Boston, and based on where the user wants to start 
            their day in Boston, we find and recommend restaurants. To see which restaurant are safer to eat 
            at we use a dataset from Analyze Boston containing food inspection violations that go back as far
            as 2007. To see how popular each restaurant is, we use data from Yelp’s businesses API and collect
            data on restaurant and bars around Boston. And finally, we use Google Maps’ Geocoding API to 
            evaluate distances between recommended bars, and the user’s starting point. Using these datasets, 
            we use constraints to choose restaurants to recommend.
