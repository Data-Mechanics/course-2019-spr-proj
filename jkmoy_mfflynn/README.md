<b> Project #1 </b>

The datasets that we chose to retrieve are one that are based on emergency services in Boston. We pulled things like car accidents, fire reports, and crime reports. We are not sure yet of the one problem that we wish to solve using our data and its transformations, but we were interesting in seeing the statistics from which these incidents happened. For our data on fire and the # of fire departments, we totaled the number of fire calls (whether it was real or accident) by town and divided by the number of fire departments in that town to see average incidents per department. For our car accident data, we totaled the amount of occurences for every pair of mode and location to see how the pairs were more dangerous than others. For our final transformation, using the crime dataset, we counted the occurences per crime based on the day of the week, in order to see if crimes occured on some days more than the others.

To run our code, clone the data and cd into the top-level directory and run:
