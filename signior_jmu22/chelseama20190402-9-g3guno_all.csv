Chelsea Police need to do something about this, someone is going to get seriously hurt. I honestly have to sympathize with the road raggers, it is very frustrating watching everyone else break the law make up their own traffic laws and they never ever have to pay for it. The people that do abide by the rules get rewarded with high statewide insurance rates because of all the idiots on the road.

Sadly, in the last two years, the park has become an eyesore. Almost half of it is now mostly dirt, which turns into mud during rain/bad weather. The perimeter, which was once meticulously weeded and mulched, is now becoming infested with weeds and hasnât been mulched in two years. If it werenât for neighbors with green thumbs, the garden in the middle would probably also be full of weeds. Another neighbor has been known to mow the grass himself when it gets too high because it seems that keeping the grass manicured is no longer a priority. The only thing to have changed recently is the sprinklers are back on.. I wonder if part of the neglect/lack of upkeep is because many people in the neighborhood have dogs and use the park to walk them - and the City figures that the park will be ruined by the dog traffic. This is an understandable concern, but one that I do not think is merited, as the majority of dog owners using the park live in the neighborhood and care about whether or not it is in good shape. If maintenance is a budgetary issue, I find that disappointing, as I have to believe that waterfront residents are one of the highest paying taxpayer groups in the city.

Specifically, at the Beacon Street stop the buses are constantly revving their engines from the Beacon Street off-ramp to rush to a complete stop at Beacon Street stop. Then they again will almost always intensely rev the engine to rush to yet another complete stop at the stop sign at the corner of Beacon and Broadway, which is no longer than 30-40 YARDS AWAY! I have read this complaint before and the response points to writing down the bus #'s that excessively speed/stop noisily, but that will not solve the core issue here. I would suggest possibly moving the bus stop to a somewhat non-residential type of location right around the corner possibly by the Chelsea Trial Courthouse and 7-Eleven. At least then the stop and go type of noise would be occuring primarily in more of a commercial setting with the same functionality and accessibility that is currently available. Please take the time to come up with a well-thought out response and not something unresolving and irrelevant to the situation. Thank you in advance!","2013-08-19","08/21/2013","0","1.8299","No","695779"

This week we did the same thing, they DID NOT take them, even when I ran out and asked them to do so. They said they weren't on the street so they aren't taking them. Here are two things that make this unacceptable to me: 1. The City cleared 1/2 of Crescent Ave to make room for all the teachers to park on the street for the school and yet they leave the rest of the street and the people that actually have to live here with 6 foot bankings on either side of the driveways so there is no place to put garbage at all. I can't even get out of my driveway without nearly hitting a kid I can't see or making a 30 point turn because the road is so narrow. If you think this is safe for students walking to school - I can assure you it isn't. 2. While I appreciate the situation that the snow has caused for everyone and I know that the orange garbage bags are cheap, I think its a ridiculous request of people especially buildings with multiple dwellings to expect them to rebag their garbage and take out of containers just to accommodate trash removal. It's the city's responsibility to ensure the streets can accommodate the daily necessary services that it provides especially when taxpayers are footing the bill. Even more so when animals get into that trash and strew it all over the streets. Our building doesn't have an area of parking spaces in front of us we can use to put garbage cans like some of our neighbors.

The last significant snow fall was about a week ago. A week later, Eastern Ave is unacceptable! Broadway is a embarrassing! How is it possible that snow removal on both of these main thorough-ways has still not been done!? The snow was only plowed down the middle of the road. But now there are huge snow banks at least 4-5 feet off the curb. Cars parked on Eastern Ave are sitting half into the flow of traffic. The same applies around the block on Broadway! Where are homeowners/residents expected to park? The way Broadway was plowed (or lack there of) near the creek next to Walgreens is somewhat of a disgrace!?? Because these streets were left how they were, it just adds to the daily traffic gridlock. It's actually sad that no one has still done anything about it! Every other surrounding city (Everett, Malden, Revere, etc) are working day and night to remove the piles of snow on the main roads...to widen the streets so cars can park and not impede on traffic but Chelsea has still not addressed these two main streets.

We appreciate all the hard work by the dpw but Eastern ave has been a mess since day one. I've been a Chelsea resident for over 40 yrs and have never seen such an awful job at plowing a Main Street and truck route. Why make a street a snow emergency and then proceed to plow 6 ft off of the curb? I've noticed every town in the surrounding area cleaning up the snow piles on main streets such as Broadway, Revere and other major streets in other city's. I've noticed that some snow removal was indeed performed on Broadway but we the residents of Eastern ave have seen no such clean up on our street. Most of us don't have driveways and parking on the street is our only option. The issue here is that cars are in the middle of the street causing some cars to be side swiped, huge traffic jams, and people having to walk in the middle of traffic which includes big heavy trucks just to enter their vehicle. As a fellow long time tax payer I hope that this issue can be resolved before any further action is taken. Also one more thing, please take a look of Broadway in front of the Chelsea creek. People walking in the middle of the street just to get to and from Revere. The issue here is that the plow drivers decides that 10 ft off of the curb was a justifiable distance for a Main Street.

Rodents are an issue in this area and I have seen rats climbing the snowbanks to reach this trash. Is it possible to locate landlord and fine them/ hold them responsible? I have spoken with one tenant, and their response indicated an unwillingness to clean up the trash and/or prevent problems like this for the whole community by moving the bags from the side of their home and placing them closer to street on collection days to make them accessible to the garbage truck. I believe they will simply continue throwing trash bags on top of bags until Spring or until Congress Ave is overrun by rats, whichever comes first. The trash collectors by the way have been doing a good job on our block overall especially considering the weather and traffic obstacles that they have had to cope with in past few weeks. It is unfair to expect them to dig trash bags that have been buried under weeks of snow. Tenants/homeowners also have a responsibility to make it possible for the trash collectors to do their job - everyone else on our block has similar snow issues but has managed to place their trashbags in places the collectors can reach .

The owner lives on the 2nd floor and renters on the 1st floor. I have counted 3 different families who are making the 1st floor their home. I think there is a law against overcrowding and overpopulation of rental apartments. 87 Garland Street is a residential property that has 6-8 off street parking spots available for use, however; the owner does not allow the tenants to park in these spots instead he opts to let them take up all available off street spots leaving the rest of the neighborhood (Property owners / Tax payers) without any place to park. The 75-91 block of Garland has 11 multi family homes and 3 single family homes. According to zoning ordinances (2 spots per unit) An estimated 52 off street spots are needed for parking. A quick estimate of driveways in the area show parking availability for 35 cars. There are approximately 11 off street spaces available. So in total the 75-91 Block of Garland Street can handle 46 vehicles (IF EVERYONE FOLLOWS THE RULES) as you can see by running the numbers parking is at a shortage up here. According to city zoning ordinance Landlords are required to provide to tenants 2 off street parking spots.

At some point the city allowed One North to build 240 apartments which under normal circumstances should have totaled about 360 parking spaces for the average person building a new home in the city. 1.5 parking spots per apartment is the requirement however special permission was given so this development would come to Chelsea. Although the original plans included X amount of parking spaces, far below the cities requirement, and half of those spaces required a $75.00 monthly fee on top of rent, electric, water and sewer charges, causing a major parking issue to developed in the area. Sixth St from Spruce St out to Heard is packed creating a hazard for turning vehicles due to signage allowing vehicles to use both the left and center lanes to turn onto Sixth Street to get into route 1 north. There should be no parking from the Sixth Street entrance to One North out to Spruce Steeet to allow the safe flow of vehicle and pedestrians. I know the new development that is currently under construction is going to experience the same problem most likely to majorly effect Blossom and Carter Streets not to mention the Chelsea Clock Development. Maybe the city could help rectify this issue by having management stop charging for parking spaces and if management refuses then those spaces shouldn't be counted in the original parking plans. Sixth Street parking does need to be addressed ASAP before a major accident happens.","2016-01-29","02/01/2016","0","2.4292","Yes","2195996"

I get that politicians need political alliances to facilitate and maintain their positions ""everyone needs to earn a living"". Subsequently due to low turn out at the discussion meeting the ruling was put through and we lost our parking protection. Initially the hospital employees only consumed all of our parking from 6am - 3pm however now it is an all day and weekend ordeal. 2nd and 3rd shift and weekend employees are taking all of our parking. I have battled this from the very beginning but I have no strength against the city manager. I am writing to you now in hopes that you can provide me with direction on what to do. I no longer can have guests visit as they have no place to park my once happy home has been encumbered. The neighbors are so sick and tired of hospital parkers that they have resorted to parking all of their vehicles on the street rather than in their driveways as a measure to dissuade hospital parkers this results in no parking available in a 2-3 block radius. It is awful up here and absolutely NO ONE in city hall cares... I am in tears, I am beginning to resent living in Chelsea, This is my home I built and remade it I am attached to it YET I am being held prisoner in a very unhappy situation taken advantage of by politicians and I have no available recourse.. There is not even a city lot up here for people to park in there is not available space. WHY HAVE THEY CITY POLITICIANS DONE THIS TO US FOR A HSOPITAL THAT SITS IN EVERET?

"1","85 Marlborough Street","Chelsea","MA","2150","Archived","Trash on Private Property","Trash being disposed in my yard","I could use some advice on an ongoing issue with trash being thrown into our back yard. Ever since we bought our home a year ago, we have regularly experienced trash being thrown into our yard from the neighbors who live in the large multi family home behind our property. At first we thought it was incidental, or being blown into our yard unintentionally. However, we have discovered through our security camera footage that trash is in fact being thrown over the fence by people. Here are two screenshots from the footage: one from last September and another from last month. Yesterday, we discovered razor blades were thrown into our yard, which is the third picture. We would like to enjoy our outdoor space but are hesitant to do much landscaping or improvements to the space while this issue continues. We also have two small dogs and it is concerning that we have to scan the yard for suspicious items before we let them out into our own property. In addition to the razor blades and bags of trash, we've found used diapers, broken glass bottles, and bags of used kitty litter in our yard. Unfortunately, the quality of our camera footage is not good enough to capture faces and the multi family behind us on Grove Street (88 and 90) is a large building - probably at least 8 units. It's not clear to us who to approach about this issue, but I am hoping the city can help us navigate the issue and enforce city codes on trash disposal. Thank you.","2017-06-05","06/15/2017","0.191","10.266","No","3465569"

I do appreciate the detailed information from you because for the past 3-4 years, the response from Joe Foti and the ladies in the DPW office has beenâ¦âyouâre on the listâ. Yesterday, my sidewalk did get somewhat of a repairâ¦.RJ Deveraux, the construction company doing the work on the gas pipe replacementsâ¦.did fill in one of the side walk squares with tarâ¦.it is a square that had the water coverâ¦.I guess tar is okay but the appearance is somewhat neighborhood slum lookingâ¦..it just looks so patched up and cracked all up and down the sidewalks on the streetâ¦..itâs very discouraging but I do appreciate the straight response/information from you. Unfortunately, my DPW frustrations continueâ¦.the rats are on the street in broad day in greater numbers than everâ¦and if the I donât call the DPW office every week from April to October nothing is done proactively.

I was wondering if the city was responsible, or a resident. I am concerned for several reasons, as a pet owner. First, I don't know if my dog would be able to get into the rat poison, or where it was placed. It worries me walking the dog in the dark, where I won't be able to see it, or even what it might look like, whereas my dog will be able to easily find it, because it smells good to animals. My dog weighs six lbs, not much bigger than a rat, so poison would have the same effect. Second, I'm worried about the dead rats all over the place. I'm worried that people's dogs will eat them, or cats will prey on the sick rats, and pets will get poisoned themselves from eating poisoned animals. I don't know if the poison is anything pets could get into or if pets could get sick from eating dead animals, but if so, I feel like residents need to be informed of when and where the city is putting down poison, so people will know what precautions need to be taken with their pets.","2017-05-18","05/22/2017","0","3.3938","No","3424356"

Unfortunately there is no street sight to indicate that cars should not block this way and residents, are unable to enter or exit the street to go to work or return home, as it is a dead end. This happens every week day in the mornings and evenings when commuters are traveling to and from work, and it's making it impossible to break through traffic to leave the street. Attached image show street blockage due to traffic at the lights, as well as, MBTA buses and other vehicles illegally driving in the left turn only lane to go straight and cut off that backed up right lane.

Currently there are 2 left hand turn lanes, and a protected arrow, which is great. However, cars in the inner turn lane often make a wide turn, not realizing that this is now a double turn lane (it used to be 1 lane). This is very dangerous and leads to many close calls. Additionally, the parking on 6th St. makes it so that it is not really wide enough for 2 lanes once cars get onto 6th.

It was like it was put down with one of those spreaders -- got all over the sidewalk where the people who applied it probably filled the spreader, and all over the grassy areas etc -- BUT you need to warn everyone that this was done - especially those with children or dogs!! There were only two small ""warning"" signs in only one of six grass areas (rest of the areas had no signs anywhere) and those two signs were placed right next to each other in an area that you only saw after walking through the pesticide pellets!! The sign showed symbol of no children and no dogs indicating that it is not safe for either. So why In the world this pesticide was spread everywhere without adequate signage and without cleanup of sidewalks where it spilled everywhere is completely perplexing, irresponsible and completely unacceptable.

"1","170 revere beach parkway","Chelsea","MA","02150","Archived","Rats/Vermin","Rodent issues","I was at McDonaldï¿½s on revere beach parkway on 3/8/18 at 7:30pm. While I was ordering my items i noticed 4 rats running around the bushes/grass area near the drive thru. I am aware the dumpster is nearby and has always been there since I was a child and that was easily 20 plus years ago from my own memory. I question if the exterior of this restaurant is to this level, what does the interior look like? What are the sanitation issues if any? In the past 3-4 years this issue in the McDonaldï¿½s drive thru has only become exceedingly worse. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at first since we are a city, we are heavily populated, and I know the city in general has had rodent issues (especially the last 4+ years) I thought maybe the first few times was rogue but itï¿½s becoming worse and worse. If McDonaldï¿½s is at this level of rodent issues, imagine the surrounding homes, businesses, etc. that battle the issues (invasion of rats/mice) or have issues but do not rectify them and the rat/mice population just breeds and breeds and becomes even worse. I have seen mice/rats on my own street as well as around the city. I understand we are a city and with the city comes rodents. However, the city needs to step up their efforts in rectifying these problems. My family has called city hall on numerous occasions to be told they bait the sewers and offer residential baiting programs. That is great and all but it is not even close to enough. I do not want to be pushed out of the city I grew up in because of rats and never wanting to go in my own yard at night in fear of the rats. My household has had professional treatments (exterior/interior) as proactive measures for quite a few years now. It disgusts me that when I pick up something in my yard, did I come into contact with rodent urine/feces? The city needs to be aware children are citizens of the city too and itï¿½s unsanitary for kids (or anyone) to play in their yards and come into contact with rodent urine/feces. The city itself and the residents and business owners of Chelsea need to be proactive and together as a community we can get a better handle on the rodent population. If homeowners/business owners recognize an issue, it immediately needs to be treated. If a neighbor has a burrow or the owner themselves have one or you see rats entering homes or around homes, it needs to be taken care of properly. If a neighbor is not fixing their issues the city needs to visit these homes/business and tell the owners to fix the problem and that comes with neighbors coming together and becoming one as a community. I watched the Facebook live video the city had about the rat issues and I think it left many people still questioning what the city is doing to help. We need help with this issue! Iï¿½ve seen this city though many phases in my 30 plus years here and this is a major issue and we canï¿½t do it alone!","2018-03-08","03/15/2018","3.4528","6.7986","No","4216067"

The CPD and city manager promised frequent supervision of this portion of Cherry Street by both Chelsea Parking Authority & PD, yet they make ZERO rounds. Yesterday afternoon there were half a dozen cars parked all afternoon on this street, forcing walkers to go on the Street, putting themselves in danger because people simply dont care about others. Multiple calls were made to the police station about these cars yesterday afternoon, ZERO cops showed up... the cars illegally parked on the sidewalks didnt leave until 7-8pm! Explain to me why is it ok for these people to block sidewalks, block driveways and be a danger? I know the police have other priorities, which is fine I understand, but to ignore these calls over and over again it is mind blowing. I've checked the History of reported issues for this street and there are multiple for the past years and it seems like the city is neglecting the safety of people. I noticed someone (not recent) reported the INT of Cherry St & Second St, no action was done until recent.. was it because there was a big accident at that given location about a month ago?!","2018-06-04","06/05/2018","0","0.7556","No","4523477"

Little pellets of the pesticide were everywhere! It was like it was put down with one of those spreaders -- got all over the sidewalk where the people who applied it probably filled the spreader, and all over the grassy areas etc -- BUT you need to warn everyone that this was done - especially those with children or dogs!! There were only two small ""warning"" signs in only one of six grass areas (rest of the areas had no signs anywhere) and those two signs were placed right next to each other in an area that you only saw after walking through the pesticide pellets!! The sign showed symbol of no children and no dogs indicating that it is not safe for either. So why In the world this pesticide was spread everywhere without adequate signage and without cleanup of sidewalks where it spilled everywhere is completely perplexing, irresponsible and completely unacceptable.

"1","170 revere beach parkway","Chelsea","MA","2150","Archived","Rats/Vermin","Rodent issues","I was at McDonaldâs on revere beach parkway on 3/8/18 at 7:30pm. While I was ordering my items i noticed 4 rats running around the bushes/grass area near the drive thru. I am aware the dumpster is nearby and has always been there since I was a child and that was easily 20 plus years ago from my own memory. I question if the exterior of this restaurant is to this level, what does the interior look like? What are the sanitation issues if any? In the past 3-4 years this issue in the McDonaldâs drive thru has only become exceedingly worse. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at first since we are a city, we are heavily populated, and I know the city in general has had rodent issues (especially the last 4+ years) I thought maybe the first few times was rogue but itâs becoming worse and worse. If McDonaldâs is at this level of rodent issues, imagine the surrounding homes, businesses, etc. that battle the issues (invasion of rats/mice) or have issues but do not rectify them and the rat/mice population just breeds and breeds and becomes even worse. I have seen mice/rats on my own street as well as around the city. I understand we are a city and with the city comes rodents. However, the city needs to step up their efforts in rectifying these problems. My family has called city hall on numerous occasions to be told they bait the sewers and offer residential baiting programs. That is great and all but it is not even close to enough. I do not want to be pushed out of the city I grew up in because of rats and never wanting to go in my own yard at night in fear of the rats. My household has had professional treatments (exterior/interior) as proactive measures for quite a few years now. It disgusts me that when I pick up something in my yard, did I come into contact with rodent urine/feces? The city needs to be aware children are citizens of the city too and itâs unsanitary for kids (or anyone) to play in their yards and come into contact with rodent urine/feces. The city itself and the residents and business owners of Chelsea need to be proactive and together as a community we can get a better handle on the rodent population. If homeowners/business owners recognize an issue, it immediately needs to be treated. If a neighbor has a burrow or the owner themselves have one or you see rats entering homes or around homes, it needs to be taken care of properly. If a neighbor is not fixing their issues the city needs to visit these homes/business and tell the owners to fix the problem and that comes with neighbors coming together and becoming one as a community. I watched the Facebook live video the city had about the rat issues and I think it left many people still questioning what the city is doing to help. We need help with this issue! Iâve seen this city though many phases in my 30 plus years here and this is a major issue and we canât do it alone!","2018-03-08","03/15/2018","3.4528","6.7986","No","4216067"

The vehicle was moved the last day of February and they were back on the street 2 days later. Iâm assuming someone is using the street as storage and leaving It until they are told they would be towed. Does the city have regulations on leaving vehicles for excessive amounts of time not being moved, cleaned or touched? The last time they left it for 2 months and debris was gathering underneath. I foresee this may be a reoccuring issue. It has snowed and I have yet to see a anyone shovel out the car or clean it.

I have been living in Chelsea for over a year and not once seen them park any of their vehicles in their 2 car garage. Instead the park in front of their garage on the sidewalk. This becomes a problem when people have to leave the sidewalk to walk in the street to pass their house. I've seen 10 year old kids drive their bikes in the street, parents walk in the street with their babies in a stroller. Last week at night I walk into the street and almost got sideswiped by a oncoming car. This is a blind corner for cars turning off of Washington ave going full/half speed and will lead to an accident. I am just reporting this now on record so if any accidents happen I can say I mentioned it. Like I said they have been parking like this for over a year. If you look on Google Street View you can see an old snapshot from years ago and there is a car parked the same way.

On the parking issue I believe if people followed the rules we would not have a parking shortage this neighborhoods streets and parking was not designed to support 10-12 vehicles per home.

To The City Manager City of Chelsea Dear Sir/ Madam: 1. I own the above mentioned unit and it is being rented to a tenant starting 08/01/2017. 2. On 07/18/2017, after downpour, sewage water backed up and overflowed in our bathroom. The water was full of human waste and other dirt and spilled over to the rest of the unit. 3. According to the conversations with other owners and tenants in the building, such incident has never happened since the construction of the unit in 2014. 4. We cleaned and disinfected the house but found out to our disappointment that there is damage to the hardwood floor of the house. 5. The incident happened again after a week when it rained and we brought it to the attention of sewer department on the phone (phone number). We were told that this was an anomaly and there is nothing wrong with the sewer system. The city officials have checked and the incident will not happen again. 6. After the rain yesterday (08/02/2017), to our disappointment, the backup and spillover of water from the bathroom happened yet again. 7. The same incident has happened in the unit next door (Unit #5) 8. This shows that the problem of overflow is more widespread than just this unit. It also shows us that there was negligence on part of the concerned officials who reported that this was an anomaly and will not happen again. 9. This is for your immediate necessary action so that we donât suffer inconvenience and harassment from this incident again. 10. Hoping for an immediate action and response please.

Elevator buttons are constantly broken causing residents to have to get off at a different floor and walk. A few weeks ago the elevator was down for an entire week and those dissabled or handicapped were left to suffer. Recently there was some type of excessive water damage and the entire first and second floor were flooded. For a week the elevator would go down but could not be called to go up due to the excessive water damage through the ceiling on the first floor, destroying the electrical units around the elevator. As of today, the elevator will not go up or down. Not only are all of the residents unsure if the elevator is even SAFE after this damage, and unsure of the hazard level from the moldy smell throughout the first and second floor of he building, there was NO notice explaination or communication sent out about any of these issues. Not once did the complex send out a memo or email any time the elevator has been down. When the two floors were flooded and water was leaking through the entire roof of the parking garage, not a single resident even knew what was going on. They still have not notified or sent out any memo of what is possibly going on. Many residents have sent emails and phone calls and chelsea place apartments have not answered any emails or phone calls. They will not respond about these issues. The two stair wells to use are poorly planned, one accessible from a locked to only those paying for the parking garage that leads to one end of the building far from the elevator. The other stairwell that leads close to the elevator is only accessible by going outside and to the far back of the building. It is nearly impossible to live in this building if you are unable to use the stairs. The water damage to the elevator and ceilings and floors puts us all in danger. No money has been taken off of any residents rent even after all of these inconviences.","2017-08-03","08/14/2017","0.016","10.9486","No","3608860"

I moved it back to where it was sitting for over a month. Since we do not have vehicles, we have no way to remove this abandoned car seat.

Maybe a sign saying ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½trucks must turn rightï¿½Û would help direct them. On several occasions Broadway had to be shut down by police for an extended period of time to get cars moved so that the truck(s) can make the turn.

Also the rodent problem that is occurring from the overgrown vegetation caused from the tree. I constantly see rats nesting along the fallen branches and leaves. Their rear fence is holding up part of the tree that fell. The branches from the fallen trunk nearly reached the dividing fence that seperates the Tobin from this empty lot area. There is trash that has been dumped in this area, previously reported on Issue (2704831), that still has not been completely picked up or cleared.

A attractive city draws people in and people that are drawed in is more business and etc. Iï¿½Ûªve noticed Chelsea has had lots of upgrades from the sidewalks to the streets with paint and just overall general upgrades, but Iï¿½Ûªve noticed the Main Street of Broadway and specifically near 725 Broadway has been so neglected. There are no trees planed in that street to create a more beautiful community... like in other streets. There arenï¿½Ûªt lights added like there is in the city of revere... mind you this street of Broadway connects to revere! It is just so neglected... no plants or city trees being built. I would love to see more of a effort being made to this street and not just the city hall and other streets. There is a new apartment complex being build behind in this Broadway street and a better looking street could do so much. There are my suggestions because I am a part of rigid community and would love to see it flourish all in every single street and area.

"117","Washington Ave","Chelsea","MA","02150","Archived","Other","Intersection of Rt. 16 and Washington Ave","Hello, I am writing this post with concern to the intersection of Rt. 16 and Washington Ave. The reconfiguration of this intersection in my opinion has only made traffic worse and the possibility of accidents even worse. I have been a Chelsea resident for over 30 years and never have seen traffic and congestion in this area at this level. The traffic heading towards route 16, coming down past Washington Park has been absolutely terrible during morning school/work commute. Washington Ave traffic heading towards route 16 has been backed up to the top of Cheever St. most mornings. This is without the bus picking children up either at Washington Park (obviously the bus needs to stop and make sure the children get on safely) A major area of concern is turning left off Sagamore more onto Washington Ave. This turn causes back up of Sagamore Ave and people cannot exit safely out of Sagamore due to the back up and congestion. It probably doesnï¿½Ûªt help either that the smaller portion of Murray has been a do not enter for some time due to road work or construction vehicles being in the road. I feel it would be more beneficial for people in the area if the pattern is changed in that intersection and traffic can flow a little easier and safer. I see many cars passing cars from the left lane on Washington and taking a right onto the parkway heading towards Everett. This is extremely unsafe and unnecessary. As a long time Chelsea resident Iï¿½Ûªve seen the old road pattern and the new and neither was great but this new pattern is even worse than the old in my opinion. Thank you for your time.","2018-11-15","11/15/2018","0","0.1389","No","5122448"
