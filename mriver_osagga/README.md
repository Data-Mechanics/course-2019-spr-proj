## Narrative

In Boston, hundreds of 311 Requests are called in daily by residents demanding maintenance of their respective vicinities. When searching the 311 request dataset, we came up with a few interesting questions regarding Boston and the maintenance of its neighborhoods: Are the areas that are most vulnerable being maintenanced? How does economic status of residents influence the types of requests that are called in and the time it takes the workers to fulfill a request? Should Boston be addressing these vulnerable areas regardless of received requests or not, given those areas may have residents whom are incapable of calling in a request? Does education play a roll in determining whether residents stop and take the time to call in requests for the good of the community? 


For project 1 we will be producing 3 datasets:
Boston Ages by Neighborhood 
Boston Income by Neighborhood
Boston Education by Neighborhood
To create these data sets, we performed some projections/selections/aggregation to clean the datasets and extract the demographics we were interested in. 


Eventually, we will be combining these datasets with the `311 requests` datasets and perform some relational operations in order to study the types of requests and how they are influenced by the neighborhood demographics. Hopefully, after multiple transformations, we will be able to see a meaningful correlation that will answer our questions.
