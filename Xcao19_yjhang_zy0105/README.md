# Project 2

### Narrative

Boston is a beatiful city, many people live here. We find that the properties in different area have totally different value. So finding out the factor that influences the value of properties is an interesting topic. We could combine the location of propertie, schools, community centers, police stations and community center pools together to figure out how the value of properties could be affected. We may also find out how will the value of properties increase/decrease if there are more/less schools, community centers, police stations and community center pools nearby.
