Datasets used:
- AirBNB listings
- AirBNB neighborhoods
- AnalyzeBoston crime incident reports from Aug 2015 until present
- AnalyzeBoston streetlight locations
- AnalyzeBoston police station
- Zillow average home values for various neighborhoods in the US

These data sets all contain information about the characteristics of various locations within the US. With AnalyzeBoston's data combined with the other data sets, we can generate a specific set of attributes per location which can help answer questions about average AirBNB rates, housing rates, and safety of each location. As a graduating student, these are key pieces of information that I would use to identify the convenience, safety, and cost of living across the Boston area. By looking at the data provided, a person who is unfamiliar with the Boston area could make calculated decisions about which areas of Boston best suit their needs. I think it will also be useful to see the relationships between the cost of AirBNBs and the average value of homes in each neighborhood.
