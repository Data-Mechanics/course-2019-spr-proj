# Project 1 Description #

I have retrieved the following data sets:

- Boston Fire Alarm Boxes
- Boston Fire Hydrants
- Boston Fire Departments
- Boston Public Schools
- Boston Non Public Schools

from https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets. The purpose of my project is to compare the availability of fire safety resources (namely fire hydrants, fire alarm boxes, and fire departments) at Boston public schools to the availability of the same resources at Boston non public schools. I have accomplished this with three data transformations, each of which combines both the public school and the non public school data sets with one other data set, producing two new data sets. For hydrants and alarm boxes, the transformations involved counting how many of each resource was within one half mile of each school. For departments, the transformation involved finding the distance to the fire department nearest to each school.
