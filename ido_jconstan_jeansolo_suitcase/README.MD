We have 5 data sets:
1) BU-TRANSPORTATION-STUDY
2) Property Assessment
3) Boston Greenhouse Gas Emissions
4) Public Works Active Work Zones
5) Traffic Count Locations
We combine these in three ways, documented below.

Goal: Combine house price with people who take the bus  
Justification: As we have been tasked to find reasons why so many students are not taking the bus, we want to see if there is a correlation between house prices and whether or not a student takes the bus. It may be possible that many families cannot afford to take a bus, or even that families that are well off may not see the value in paying for a bus ride when the parents themselves can take their children to school. This is shown in two different transformations: one for those who take the bus, and one for those who don't.
  
Goal: Show the ratio of students that take the bus to students who don't.
Justification: This will give us a good idea of the percentage of students that aren't using the bus, and give us a good number to point at in an argument for the benefits of better bus routes.
