<h1>CS 504 Project</h1>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

Boston is a large growing city, and public transportations is an important aspect of its city planning. In recent years bike sharing systems like Bluebikes become more and more popular, and now it has over 2500 bikes and 260 stations around Boston. People like me ride their bikes every day and it's really convenient. However, the placement of their bike stations are not very reasonable, and that brings bad experiences to its users (for example: college students like me). For example, Blue bikes only has one bike station with 10 docks at BU campus, and sometimes when I ride to the campus, I have to look for another bike station nearby because that one is already full. I was actually late twice for CS504 class this semester because of this! That makes me thinking: if Bluebikes can learn more about their bike-using situation and place their bike stations more properly, it will be very nice for their users. Thus the purpose of this project is to find out which places are good choices for placing new Bluebikes stations or replacing old ones.

The first step to address the problem is to look for some datasets that are useful for this project. I picked 5 datasets and I'll introduce them below. The second move is to use these datasets to get some information I need, that requires me to perform some data transformations. After project 1, I’ve analyzed the Bluebike trip data and other information and found out how many bike stations are close to each college and university. I also got the frequency of Bluebike trip around each college. Then in project 2, I did some statistical analysis to see if college students are the main customer of the Bluebike service and if it’s practicable to place more bike stations for them. I also got some statistics about the relation between a college’s student number, bike station number and trip number. Then I set some constraints and solve them as satisfaction and optimization problems so that I can find out what is the best strategy to place new bike stations nearby colleges and universities (so students' riding experience can be enchanced at most under the same condition). After that I got some updated statistics between these information and compared them with the old one. Thus, the problem of where to place new Bluebike stations can be adressed by data mechanics tools and techniques. After all these works, I added some interactive web-based visualizations which can be displayed in a standard web browser so that people can easily understand what I've achieved.



<h2>Datasets</h2>
There are five datasets at this time, each has a retrieve algorithm in separated python files:

Subway stop locations:<br>

Bus stop locations:<br>
http://datamechanics.io/data/yufeng72/Bus_Stops.csv

College and university locations:<br>
http://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cbf14bb032ef4bd38e20429f71acb61a_2.csv

Bluebike station locations:<br>
https://s3.amazonaws.com/hubway-data/Hubway_Stations_as_of_July_2017.csv

Bluebike trip data 2018.9:<br>
http://datamechanics.io/data/yufeng72/Bluebikes_Tripdata_201809.csv



<h2>Transformations</h2>

Implemented 3 transformations, all three using selection, projection and combination:

Transformation 1: find bus stops, colleges and universities with valid latitude and longitude in Boston to find possible places for placing bike stations.

Transformation 2: calculate the distance between every Bluebike station and every college & university, then count the number of the Bluebike stations near these colleges and universities.

Transformation 3: for each college and university, find out how many Bluebike trips take them as destination (in a month) to see if it is popular.



<h2>Constraint satisfaction and Optimization</h2>

I set 2 constraints for the datasets I got above, and solve one constraint satisfaction problem and two optimization

Constraint 1: Add some new bike stations nearby colleges and universities and achieve this situation: for all colleges and universities, the ratio of around trip number and around station number are less than 600? First I solved the satisfaction problem with new bike station number 20, and after get the answer 'No', calculate what is the smallest number of new bike stations to satisfy the constraint (the answer for this optimization problem is 55). Implemented in OptimizationIdealStations.py.

Constraint 2: Add that much bike stations at one time is not practical, so how about add a small number (let's say X) of new bike stations, and let the average ratio of around trip number and around station number (of all colleges and universities) as small as possible? I solved this optimization problem using X = 1 in OptimizationLimitStations.py.



<h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>

I did some statistical analysis to see if college students are the main customer of the Bluebike service and if it’s practicable to place more bike stations for them. I also got some statistics about the relation between a college’s bike station number, bike trip number and student number. After I solved the constraint satisfaction and optimization problems, I got some of these statistics (like correlation coefficients) updated and compared them with the old one.

Code implemented in StatisticalAnalysis.py.



<h2>Running the Execute Script for the Project</h2>

Run in trial mode (whole datasets):
```
python execute.py yufeng72
```
Run in trial mode (where retrive function read less data and the algorithm work on less data):
```
python execute.py yufeng72 --trial
```
on my machine, running in normal mode takes about 1 minute, while running in trial mode takes less than 10 seconds.



<h2>Visualization</h2>

To run visualization, first run execute.py as described above, and copy auth.json and config.json to /web.

In /web, run:
```
python app.py
```
