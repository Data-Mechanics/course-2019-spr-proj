## Derived Datasets

<b>Dataset 1(num_per_street1):</b> We unioned the Boston address and accessing datasets and took counts for every address and removed any duplicates. Then, we called map reduce to aggregate sum on every address in order to get the number of properties/buildings per street. Our new datasets show 355 unique streets in South Boston. 

<b>Dataset 2 (type_amount):</b> We took two Zillow API calls (getPropertyData and getSearchResults) and combined them to get the different types of units and their average cost. We did this by first filtering out only the South Boston addresses then took the product and took out the duplicates. Finally we combined the two datasets by taking the average of the amounts and mapping it to the respective unit type. 

<b> Dataset 3 (newly_renovated_5_years): </b> The Zillow API and Permit records were unioned to get the most recent constructions in South Boston. We used map reduce to filter out the most recent renovations that happened in the last 5 years.  

With these three new datasets, we can gain a better understanding of the status of South Boston and itâ€™s streets and potential properties to keep an eye on. With this information we can see which streets are most populated and which streets are more family friendly by figuring out which units are more cost efficient and newly renovated. This is particularly beneficial for the South Boston Neighborhood Development because this gives them an idea of which streets contain more individual houses vs apartments and offers them the ability to keep an eye on up and coming streets.
