#Project 2

We have added an algorithm that interprets flood and district data and returns an optimal barrier or "wall" that can cut off flooding using the smallest distance for that wall. We did this by splitting the flood map polygon into smaller polygons based on the collection of subdistrict polygons. Additionally, we added a value, that described where the flooding ended on land, as this edge would not have to be added onto a wall, and could be subtracted from the perimeter of a solution polygon. Using z3, we described the set of all states, as that including every possible polygon combination obtained from the fractured flood map. The optimization looks for the greater achievable area with a given wall length. The wall length is measured to be the perimeter length of the combined polygon, minus the length of any edge that borders unflooded dry land. To subtract this border, we used the value that was added the parameters for each sub-district earlier in the algorithm.

Additionally, we performed a statistical analysis on the effect of flooding on traffic. We did so by demonstrating how significantly busy flooded areas were compared to the non flooded areas.
