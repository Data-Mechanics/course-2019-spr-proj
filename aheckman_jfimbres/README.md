Narrative and Justification:

In this project we incorporated United States Partisan Map data on republican and democrat belief in global warming by state, 
along with U.S. census data for population by state, state energy-related CO2 emissions both adjusted and unadjusted and
carbon intensity by state. The purpose of gathering these datasets was to help determine if there is a correlation between
belief in global warming and CO2 emissions per capita. We also wanted to determine if states with higher global warming belief
rates had a higher carbon efficiency rate. Ultimately, we want to see if increased acceptance of global warming has an impact
on how the states of the U.S. handle CO2-related processes. The CO2 emissions paired with the population data allow us to
calculate an estimate for CO2 emissions per capita for each state. Using the carbon intensity data we are able to calculate
carbon efficacy, and we can pair this with the partisan map data to be able to view the efficacy relative to the republican
and democrat belief rate by state.  

Data ideosyncracies.

All but one of the data sets are free, available online, and have no authorization requirements.  We needed to subscribe to a
Yale mailing list at http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/partisan-maps-2018/
?est=happening&group=dem&type=value&geo=cd to download the Partisan Map data, but didnâ€™t need to provide that authorization in
our script.
