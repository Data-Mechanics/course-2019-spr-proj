# Chicago Transit Zones

CS504 - Data Mechanics

## Intent
The City of Chicago currently has a flat rate of $2.50 for entry into the Elevated Rail ("L") transit system. Other metropolitan transit systems such as Transport for London's Tube network have fare zones where, depending on your entry and exit into the system, a fare may be higher or lower. While the "L" infrastructure is currently incapable of tracking when passengers exit the system, is it still possible for Chicago to benefit from zone-based fares?

Using data on station popularity, community socioeconomic hardship, and taxi pick-up and drop-off, fare zones can be created for the "L" network that encourage transit in burdened areas of the network while offsetting this fare deficit by charging riders in more stressed parts of the network a higher fare.

### Would a zone based system for the 'L' benefit Chicago?
*To answer this question, three goals are presented:*
1. **How are the zones determined?**Â Use k-means to create varying zones, taking into account station popularity, community hardship, and area taxi demand. Each k-means cluster represents a zone, with all stations residing in a zone.
2. **What would the zones look like?** Web-based visualizations are created to demonstrate a CTA map with the new zones. 
3. **Are the metrics used significant?** Web-based visualizations of the metrics are created to demonstrate their relation to each other. Correlation tests on metrics are also performed.
