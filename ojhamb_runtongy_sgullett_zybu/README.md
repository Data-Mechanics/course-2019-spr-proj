The first transformation (age_cur_edu.py, edu_job.py, edu_work.py) for project one shows the relationship between college-educated Jordanians in Amman and their economic status. The data sets we used for this transformation contained educational status (bachelor's degree, graduate degree, etc.), employment rates per year, and gender. 

The second transformation highlights the sentiments of Jordanians in Amman on political life and the current state of affairs based on their age group. Furthermore, based on their location within Amman. 

The third transformation (cluster_status.py and student_status.py) explores relationships of students in Jordan and their relationship or roots. The data sets we used for this transformation contained employment rates per year, degree type, and gender. 

Overarchingly, these transformations display the demographic (i.e. employment rates, gender, age, educational status) of people in Amman, Jordan and their sentiments on the current state of affairs. These transformations were completed using the algorithms and tools that we have learned thus far in CS504.
