The first transformation (age_cur_edu.py, edu_job.py, edu_work.py) for project one shows the relationship between college-educated Jordanians in Amman and their economic status. The data sets we used for this transformation contained educational status (bachelor's degree, graduate degree, etc.), employment rates per year, and gender. 

The second transformation highlights the sentiments of Jordanians in Amman on political life and the current state of affairs based on their age group. Furthermore, based on their location within Amman. 

The third transformation (cluster_status.py and student_status.py) explores relationships of students in Jordan and their relationship or roots. The data sets we used for this transformation contained employment rates per year, degree type, and gender. 

Overarchingly, these transformations display the demographic (i.e. employment rates, gender, age, educational status) of people in Amman, Jordan and their sentiments on the current state of affairs. These transformations were completed using the algorithms and tools that we have learned thus far in CS504.

Project 2 Justification:
For project two, we determined that the best evaluation technique to solve the problem of mapping young people in the neoliberal city of Amman, Jordan. This problem was solved using optimization. Our Linkedin.py is the script for retrieving Linkedin data. JobAnalysis.py is the script used for finding the top three necessary skills for a developer or engineer in Amman, Jordan. Our job_edu_eng.py is the script used to find three correlation coefficients between three attributes for people in our Linkedin data, which highlights their employment status, education level, and whether they speak English or not. Furthermore, from project 1, we used data sets regarding participation and attendance in classes in Amman, Jordan, to complete optimization via k-means.
We get a data set about some students performance in the school in Amman, Jordan. The data set is include the annoucements view times, discussion times, visit ted resources times and raisehands times. Our purpose is to divided those students into 4 groups and each group there should be a standard performance level. We try to make it as convincing as possible and we use k-mean as an optimization technique to cluster the student into 4 groups. The objective function is the sum of the "distance" between the student of each cluster with the centroid(which is the standard performance level) of that cluster. We are going to minimize the objective function.
