We chose five datasets from Analyse Boston: Property Assessment, Police Station, Public School, Private School and Hospitals. We are trying to develop a relationship between the average house price in each zipcode area and the number of Police station, schools and hospitals in that area. Each dataset will be transformed in the form {"zipcode": xxxxxx, "value": xxxxxx}, where the value is average house price for Property Assessments and number of corresponding facilities in this area. In this form we can find a relationship between housing price and number of public facilities.
