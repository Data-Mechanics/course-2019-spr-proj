<Project 2>
	Our problem is to find a correlation between Average house price in each zipcode and the number of public facilities in this region (ex. Police Station, School, Hospital). We will divide the problem into 2 parts:<br />
	-Develop a linear function to predict average house price using existing data. We solve this problem as a optimization problem. We define our linear function as y=w*x+b where y is the actual price, w is the weight vector, b is the bias and x is the existing data. We define the cost function of our linear function to be MSE = (1/N)âˆ‘(yi - (w * xi + b)). In our problem, we want to minimize this cost to get the best linear function to predict average house price. We employ linear regression package from scikit-learn to minimize the cost and derive the linear function for prediction.  
	-Compute the correlation between number of each facility to the housing price. We use correlation coefficient to compare the relation between each attribute (school, hospital,police station) and property price. Firstly, we extract the property value and the number of facilities mentioned above within a specific zipcode zone from the mongod collections created in project 1. Then, we use numpy as tool to calculate correlation coefficients. According to our results, each zip code has exactly one police station, so the number of police stations does not affect the property price. The number of hospital has a positve correlation with the property value. The correlation coefficient is 0.56. The number of school has the strongest positive correlation with property value, which is consistent with our expectation. The correlation coefficient is 0.69.
